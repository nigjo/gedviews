# GEDCOM-Views Collection

A collection of simple webpages to display GEDCOM data. This is not an editor (yet)!

The Site is designed as PWA and will store no data on server side. Your GEDCOM file is stored in yours browsers local storage.

## gedcom.js

The main structure of a GEDCOM file is defined in the v5.5.1 standard by
the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints".
A download link can be found on the german
["genealoby.net"-wiki](http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Gedcom). 
This site does not support any other format.

Each line in a GEDCOM file is a record. By defining a specific "level" the
records form a tree-like structure. This tree is represented by the
`Record` class in `gedcom.js`. Some special versions of `Record` are
`Family` and `Individual` to easier handle cross references between these
types of record. See `gedcom.js` for details and available methods.


## Plugins

All views are "Plug-ins". Each folder contains a `gedview.json` file with some
meta data for the view. The folders are registers in the `plugins.json` file.
The order in the array will be the same as in the applications' menu.

`geview.json`:

    {
      "target":"index.html",
      "caption":"Menutitle",
      "resources":[
        "some.css",
        "main.js",
        "picture.jpg"
      ]
    }

### Entry point

Each plugin should create a "`gedviewPage`" instance with a
`printGedviewFamily(fam, ged)` method. This is called as soon as all
data from the stored GEDCOM file is loaded and ready. This may be called
more than once.

The `fam` Parameter is the current selected `Family` record.
If the `id` of this family is `-1`, no family is selected and the plugin
should display an "empty" view.

The `ged` parameter is a link to the current `Gedcom` instance.


### basic scripts

Every plugin must import at least the first of these two script files.

    import {GedViews} from '../gedviews.js';
    //import {Gedcom, Individual, Family} from "../gedcomjs/gedcom.js";
 
At the end of each

    GedViews.setPage(new MyNewPlugin());


### Switching the current family

A plugin can switch the "current" Family. That Family is displayed with
its parents names right beneath the app title and used as initial family
for all subsequent sub-page calls.

To change the family a plugin must call itself (or another plugin page)
with the families ID as query string. The ID muss be stripped of the `@`-characters.

    window.location.href = "./myplugin.html?" + famRec.id.replace(/@/g, "");


This will also result in a page reload, so the plugin itself will be reinitialized.
The entry point is called with the "new" family.
Do not `replace()` your windows location with the new location as this will break the
"back" button in most browsers and mobile devices.

Another method is to use the function `switchFamily()` from `gedview-base.js`. You
can use a `Family` record, a `HTMLElement` with `famid` dataset entry or a string as
a parameter. The method will create the correct new location.
